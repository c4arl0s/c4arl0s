### Concurrency

Concurrency is a mechanism that decreases the response time of the system by using a single process unit. 

In Concurrency, a major task is divided into subtask that execute simultaneously but not at the same time. A good example of concurrency is having multiple applications, like a Chrome browser, a video editor, and iTunes running at the same time in an operating system.

### Parallelism

Parallelism is a mechanism that increases computational speed by using multiple processors. In parallelism, tasks execute simultaneously and at the same time. A good example of parallelism is running a video editor that has many task to perform simultaneoulsy.
